# AI-Powered Digital Radio News Aggregation System

## Overview

In today's fast-paced information environment, listeners face an overwhelming amount of news content from various sources, making it challenging to stay informed about relevant topics of interest. This project aims to develop an AI-powered digital radio news aggregation system that delivers personalized audio news updates based on listener preferences.

## Problem Statement

Traditional digital radio stations often rely on static programming schedules, leading to a disconnect between listener preferences and the news content being delivered. Existing news aggregation solutions lack the ability to provide personalized audio updates that adapt to real-time events and listener feedback. This project addresses these challenges by creating a responsive digital radio platform capable of delivering tailored news briefings.

## Features

- **Real-time News Aggregation**: Aggregate news content from diverse sources and provide comprehensive coverage of important events.
- **Personalized News Updates**: Analyze listener preferences and engagement metrics to deliver customized news briefings.
- **Audio Summarization**: Summarize complex news articles into concise audio clips for easy consumption.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjust programming dynamically based on real-time listener feedback and trending topics.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Aggregation**: News APIs, Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup, Scrapy)
- **Natural Language Processing**: spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers (for summarization and analysis)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (for recommendation systems)
- **Audio Processing**: Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly (for audio generation)
- **Frontend Development**: React, Vue.js (for user interface)
- **Backend Development**: Flask, Django (for server-side logic)
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure (for hosting and scalability)
- **Database**: MongoDB, DynamoDB (for storing user data and news content)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel (for user engagement tracking)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana (for system performance monitoring)
- **Security**: OAuth2, JWT (for secure authentication)
